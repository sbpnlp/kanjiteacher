How about doing the full recognition on the mobile device?
Is the calculating power sufficient?
What if I put the point coordinates into a byte stream?
(e.g. Memory stream that is handed over to another module)

idea for changing the algorithm:
input strokes come in
look for radicals that match
use that as a coarse classifiaction
characters that have matching radicals will be analysed further
