\chapter{Handwriting Recognition Engine}
\label{chap:handwritingrecognitionengine}

%- Why this section? 
%   The purpose of this section is to describe the software module of the 
%   HWR engine.
%   Any important of the software should be described. This is the core of the
%   HWR part of the software and therefore needs description.
%   It would be off purpose, if non-technical aspects of the HWR Engine would be 
%   described.
% - What goes into this section?
%   The main content of this section is the complete functionality of the 
%   HWR engine.
%   It should become apparent how the HWR engine works.
%   * if describing a problem: why is the problem relevant.
%     The problem of HWR is relevant, because it is the crucial novelty of the
%     application. The combination of a Kanji learning tool and a HWR is a new 
%     thing. It enables user to practice writing Kanji. (maybe too high-level for
%     this section, move to intro / motivation section).
%   * if describing a solution to a problem: 
%     what alternatives were there to solve it?    
%     Instead of a HWR engine, the user could either not have a HWR engine and
%     write on paper or not practice writing the kanji.
%     why was this solution chosen? 
%     because it creates an additional benefit, that was not available before.
%     what made it the best choice? 
%     the fact that it writing on paper is impractical and not practicing does
%     not lead to the desired result.

%     was it the optimal solution? given there is only not practicing and
%     practicing on paper: yes.

% - How will this section be structured and organised?
%   The organisational structure of the section is already layed out in the
%   sections and subsections.
% - In what style will it be written?
%   The style of writing will be technical. A technical description, using
%   pseudocode.
% - Next action - what to write first?
%   The next part to write is the general introduction to this chapter

%xxx always: what alternatives were there?

\section{Data Capturing}
\label{sec:hwre:datacapturing}

Each handwriting recognition process begins with the data capturing.
The user's handwriting must be captured and fed into the system. The data 
capturing is therefore a crucial part of the whole process. In this system 
a GUI is used for the capturing of the pen movements on a writing surface.

%this should deal with how the data are captured during the process
%mouse coordinates and stuff

%- Why this section? 
%  The purpose of this section is to describe the data capturing process.
%  It would be off purpose, if it describes to much around - the devices, the
%  transmission. This should focus on the capturing as such.
%  It should not go into great deail.
%  
%- What goes into this section?
%  The main content of this section is the technical data capturing.
%  A description of how to
%  programmatically generate a pen trajectory from reading mouse coordinates.
%  
%  * if describing a problem: why is the problem relevant.
%    The relevance of the problem is evident: Without the user's writing,
%    there would not be any handwriting recognition.
%
%  * if describing a solution to a problem: what alternatives were
%    there to solve it, why was this solution chosen? 
%    The alternatives are not massively relevant here, since they come down
%    to using different input devices, which is discussed elsewhere.
%
%    what made it the best choice? 
%    the fact that this is just how it is done.
%    was it the optimal solution?
%    yes.
%
%- How will this section be structured and organised?
%  The organisational structure of the section begins with describing the mobile 
%  input GUI from a technical level.
%  Then the class in the background that actually captures the mouse events.
%  the capturing of the mouse events.
%  the storing of the data points in lists.
% 
%- In what style will it be written?
%  The style of writing will be technical. using pseudocode if required.
%  however the algorithm is not relevant here.
%
%- Next action - what to write first?
%  The next part to write is the one about the GUI
%  also the substructuring needs to be done as required. DONE

\subsection{Writing Surface} %the mobile GUI
\label{sec:hwre:writingsurface}
%NEXT ACTION - describe writing surface and it's GUI

The writing surface module, the view is split into two parts. The writing 
surface GUI and the writing surface background module. The technical design of 
the data input GUI is described in 
section~\ref{sec:arch:handwritingdatainputview}.

\subsubsection{Writing Surface GUI}
\label{sec:hwre:writingsurfacegui}
The GUI works with pen-down and pen-up events. It has a cross in the middle in 
order to partition the writing surface the same way, character practicing paper 
sheets are usually partitioned. The GUI class is listening to \emph{pen-down}, 
\emph{pen-up} and \emph{pen-move} events. These are the equivalent in the mobile
world for regular mouse-down, mouse-up and mouse-move events. However, there is 
one difference - the pen-move event can only be captured between a pen-down and a
pen-up event. An earlier conceptual idea for the HWR engine included using the
mouse-move events during the input of a character between the strokes. This 
could not be realised, however, because the series of pen-move events can only 
be captured when there has been a previous pen-down event and no pen-up event 
yet. The GUI captures the events and passes the point coordinates on to 
the background class.

\subsubsection{Writing Surfaces Background Module}
\label{sec:hwre:writingsurfacebackground}

When a pen-down event is detected, the background class of the GUI starts 
listening for the pen movement. All point coordinates and the time of their 
capturing are stored in two separate lists with the same indeces.
An alternative solution would have been to store a number of instances of a 
custom-made encapsulated Point class including the time stamp in one list only, 
however, using two separate lists resulted in increased speed.
Therfore, the point coordinates are stored in the frameworks Point class that 
does not account for time stamps. Therefore a separate list is used for the 
timestamps only.

The background module of the writing surface mainly administrates the capturing 
of the pen trajectory and sends it to the recognition module as soon as a 
stroke is finished. Therefore the system does not receive a separate signal 
indicating that the drawing of the character is finished. That design creates 
as segmentation problem that is solved with the \emph{clear} button and the 
\emph{clear} message. The segmentation of characters is left undetermined - only 
the beginning of it is determined through the \emph{clear} message that is sent 
to the moblie view from the controller - or the clear message that is sent to 
the controller because the user clicked the \emph{reset} button.
After a stroke is finished the according point and timestamp sequences are 
passed to the main part of the HWR engine. 

\section{Data Format}
\label{sec:hwre:dataformat}

% - Why this section? 
%   The purpose of this section is to give the reader an idea of how the captured
%   data is structured. That means concretely the character format, describing
%   the HW trajectories. This is necessary in order to be able to explain the
%   mode of operation of the HWR engine in detail.

%   It would be off purpose, if the section contained a description of the 
%   lexical data, which is described in a different section.

% - What goes into this section?
%   The main content of this section is what is stated under purpose:
%   A description of how the captured data is structured.

%   * if describing a problem: why is the problem relevant.
%     The task of handwriting recognition is essentially a task 
%     working with data.
%     Therefore the structure of the data is one of the crucial points.
    
%   * if describing a solution to a problem: what alternatives were
%     there to solve it, why was this solution chosen? 

%     The solution was chosen because of its clarity, simplicity and 
%     accessibility, also because of its interoperability with potential 
%     other systems.
%     what made it the best choice? was it the optimal solution?
%     For the purpose followed with the system - yes, it was the optimal solution,
%     because it does not require much effort to parse the stored data
%     and it contains all necessary information in a structured manner.
    
% - How will this section be structured and organised?
%   The organisational structure of the section contains:

%   A general description of the XML format - why it was used as opposed to
%   other possible formats like unipen and inkml.
%   show requirements!
%   show process of how I came to current data formats.
%   include character models 1-4 on pages. - however, not everything in one go,
%   but rather in the individual sections if possible.
%   in the end, a radical has its own format that is unchanged, even
%   if internal structure of a stroke is changed.
%   (unipen is only text based, inkml does not help here, but the system allows
%   for exchange of the custom format with those)

%   data format of and representation of 
%   point, stroke, box, radical, character s. 20-23, 25f

% - In what style will it be written?
%   The style of writing will be technical - a description of the XML format.

\section{Database}
\label{sec:hwre:database}

% - Why this section? 
%   The purpose of this section is to explain the structure and production of 
%   the database.   That includes both pen trajectory and lexical data.
%   That is a relevant information, because the system provides these information,
%   therefore they must come from somewhere. In order to explain some of the
%   error recognition processes it is necessary to have these information first.

%   It would be off purpose, if anything else goes into this section.
%   The xml format is described elsewhere, the lexical charater DB comes from 
%   jim breen (cite his paper) nothing else needs be in here.

% - What goes into this section?
%   The main content of this section is a description of the character database.
%   The jim breen stuff can be pointed to, but the production process of the 
%   self made data should be described.

%   * if describing a problem: why is the problem relevant.
%     The problem is relevant, because without a character database, there won't
%     be any recognition - the system wouldn't know anything.

%   * if describing a solution to a problem: what alternatives were
%     there to solve it, why was this solution chosen? 

%     Alternatives - see alternatives of data format!
%     Technical alternatives - proper DB instead of flat-file possible,
%     but not necessary. It is actually not that much data,
%     even if all characters are included.
   
%     what made it the best choice? was it the optimal solution?
%     the fact that the alternatives do not offer a better solution.

% - How will this section be structured and organised?
%   The organisational structure of the section will contain
%   1. description of the technical format of the character data base
%      two flat files - indexed via the actual kanji character in unicode
%      format, since it is unique. this is a character-centred application!
%      how are they accessible? what format?
%      this can be seen more generic as 'the lexicon', not necessarily
%      the linguistic information about the characters, 
%      but rather the whole lexicon, including the point sequences.

%   2. discussion of alternatives: relational DB or only one flat file
%      two flat files are better, because of updates and other-language versions
%      of the jim breen lexicon. leave it unchanged! otherwise you'd need a
%      converter!

%   3. Description of the production of the lexicon.
%      it was not just taken from j.b. but it was intervowen?! (verflochten) 
%      with the trajectories. where did I get these from? 
%      how many chars are in the two dictionaries?

% - In what style will it be written?
%   The style of writing will be a technical description of how it is done.

% - Next action - what to write first?
%   The next part to write is to hash out the actual subsections.

\section{Recognition Architecture}
\label{sec:hwre:recognitionarchitecture}

% - Why this section? 
%   The purpose of this section is to give the reader an overview of the whole
%   recognition system. the recognition system! not the whole system, 
%   not the learning part.

%   It would be off purpose if other stuff would be described.
%   stick to the main focus - architecture of the pure recognition.
%   If would be off purpose if it was too detailed.
%   The actual recognition process is discussed in subsequent sections!
%   don't go into too much detail.

% - What goes into this section?
%   The main content of this section is an overview of the recognition 
%   architecture. This should not be confused with the overview of the
%   whole Kanji Coach system. it is more detailed and focused.

%   One big graphic shows the overview of the different modules.
  
%   * if describing a problem: why is the problem relevant.
%     not really a problem - every system has an architecture.
   
%   * if describing a solution to a problem: what alternatives were
%     there to solve it, why was this solution chosen? 

%     this solution was chosen after review of around 50 HWR systems.
%     the discussion of those can be found in chapter \ref{chap:onlinehwr}.
%     this section only uses pointers to that chapter.

%     what made it the best choice?
%     certainly not the lacking of alternatives, but the mix between 
%     possibilities to programmatically interact with the recognition process
%     and performance of the process.

%     was it the optimal solution?
%     yes and no.
%     it depends on the focus.
%     big discussion! WHY this architecture?
%     roughly following X and Y and Z,
%     however, not creating an optimal handwriting recognition engine.
%     research suggests that HMM models are more useful etc.
%     however - the type of error recognition desired,
%     requires a structural system.
%     it is only new in research (find that one paper 
%     that does that bloody thing) to blend HMM and structural models
%     in a hybrid HWR system, simimlar to hybrid MT systems.
%     this is interesting for outlook - point there to idea
%     HMM vs structural vs error recognition

% - How will this section be structured and organised?
%   The organisational structure of the section will be as follows:
%   1. architecture: graphic and explanatory description
%   -> Modules and parts of HWR, create graphic.

%   s. 18 zeichen, punkt usw. UML diagramme.
     
%   2. brief discussion about alternative architectures

% - In what style will it be written?
%   The style of writing will be technical
% - Next action - what to write first?
%   The next part to write is to hash out the substructure in subsections.

\section{Stroke Recognition Process}
\label{sec:hwre:strokerecognitionprocess}

% - Why this section? 
%   The purpose of this section is to describe the recognition process of a strokes
%   This is necessary, because it is a crucial part of the recognition process
%   as such, to describe which is the purpose of this chapter

%   It would be off purpose, if the radical or character recognition process 
%   would be described, too.
%   It would be off purpose, if the stroke recognition process would not be 
%   layed out in its entirety.

% - What goes into this section?
%   The main content of this section is the details of the stroke recognition
%   process. The question how it is done is central and crucial.

%   * if describing a problem: why is the problem relevant.
%     stroke recognition is not relevant as such, it becomes relevant because
%     of the recognition approach chosen, which is similar to the one of CITE

%   * if describing a solution to a problem: what alternatives were
%     there to solve it, why was this solution chosen? 
%     there are alternatives, many of which are possible. mathematical methods 
%     and formats. since roughly following \shortciteANP{Nakagawa2008}'s
%     \citeyear{Nakagawa2008} approach - the discussion of the different 
%     approaches can be left to the handwriting recognition section and the 
%     literature, however - I needed to come up with a 'good mix' of 
%     recognition quality and the possibility to extract detailed knowledge 
%     from the recognitiont process.
     
%     what made it the best choice? 
%     certainly not the lacking of alternatives, but the mix between 
%     possibilities to programmatically interact with the recognition process
%     and performance of the process.
%     see - main section! not too much repetition.

%     was it the optimal solution?

%     given the circumstances - yes, because it fulfilled the criteria 
%     (to be layed out)
%     from a pure HWR perspective - no, sinces other systems perform better on the
%     pure handwriting task.
%     from a hwr in a learning environment perspective - yes, because this
%     system gives us the ability to accompany the recognition process in detail
    

% - How will this section be structured and organised?
%   The organisational structure of the section will contain

%   1. from the captured point lists to something cooler, what are we actually
%      doing? from point to 'stroke'.

%   2. 'normalisation', including 'boxing' and then 'scaling'

%   3. curve handling. what are we doing at the edgy points?

%   4. alternative solution: time warping. doesn't need anything of the
%      abovementioned cool stuff, just one alorithm.
%      show algorithm and give a rough, rough, rough explanation,
%      maybe even without algorithm and point to papers that explain DTW.

% - In what style will it be written?
%   The style of writing will be technical and mathematical.
%   if something is calculated, show maths behind rather than algorithm.

% - Next action - what to write first?
%   The next part to write is the detailed content requirements of each subsection.

% xxx: see santosh2009 for mathematical stuff: nice description of what I'm doing

\subsection{Advanced Point Lists}
\label{sec:hwre:advancedpointlists}
%xxx this chapter used to be called:
%xxx \subsection{From Simple Point List to Boxed Representation}

what happens to the points?
nothing, really - the magic happens when normalisation and the other stuff
starts.
why this section? what's the purpose? oh, right - angles and vectors instead
of simple points. from one point to the next, or rather from on point to
ten points down the line, to get a rougher direction.
vectors make it interesting. 
impacts on curve handling! gradient and stuff can be measured in the 
vector representation (even without any boxes)
making the point list a cool mathematical object!
show code samples in pseudocode if necessary.
report about the cool stuff.

what's the similarity measure for
points and strokes?
show requirements.
what alternatives were there to consider?

\label{sec:hwre:boxing}
how is boxing done?
show requirements.
what alternatives were there to consider?
is it useful to have a similarity measure for bounding boxes?

however, what about 3D time warping?


\section{Radical Recognition Process}
\label{sec:hwre:radicalrecognitionprocess}

% - Why this section? 
%   The purpose of this section is to explain the Radical recognition process in
%   detail. It is a crucial part of the structural recognition process.
%   Therefore the purpose is evident - see purpose of chapter.

%   It would be off purpose, if there'd be too much around,
%   focus on the RRP only, nothing around.

% - What goes into this section?
%   The main content of this section is the radical recognition.
%   That contains how the model is matched to the input.
%   Incrementality of recognition, using one stroke, two strokes,
%   three strokes and so on...

%   * if describing a problem: why is the problem relevant.
%     it is a part of the structural recognition process!

%   * if describing a solution to a problem: what alternatives were
%     there to solve it, why was this solution chosen? 
%     again - part of the structural recognition process that allows for
%     interaction with the user concerning error recognition

%     what made it the best choice? was it the optimal solution?
%     here, simply the lacking of alternatives. if the recognition process
%     does not distinguish between 'shapes' and 'radicals' the error
%     handling engine would not be able to inform the user.
%     (xxx: turn this one around into a positive sentence. 
%     only through distinguishing... :xxx)
    
% - How will this section be structured and organised?
%   The organisational structure of the section will be as follows:

%     1. Representation of a radical as a stroke sequence
%     2. stroke matching, reordered stroke matching in order to find 
%        alternative radicals or radical variants, depending on the 
%        number of strokes involved in the process: stroke number, stroke sequence.

% - In what style will it be written?
%   The style of writing will be formal, showing the general algorithm.

% - Next action - what to write first?
%   The next part to write is the general algorithm as pseudocode.

% what's the similarity measure for
% radicals?
% show requirements.
% what alternatives were there to consider?

% what about stroke number and stroke sequence?
% why deal with it? can be dealt with? 
% how? why this way, why not another way?
% generally, how is radical recognition done?
% show requirements.
% what alternatives were there to consider?

\section{Character Recognition Process}
\label{sec:hwre:characterrecognitionprocess}

% - Why this section? 
%   The purpose of this section is to distinguish the radical recognition process
%   from the character recognition process.
  
%   It would be off purpose, if too much of the radical recognition process would
%   be repeaeted. 

% - What goes into this section?
%   The main content of this section is to show the actual character recognition
%   process based on the radical recognition. 
%   it should show the plan to find the appropriate characters, given a number of
%   alternative radicals.
%   s. 9/10 pixelwolke vs. reihenfolge

%   * if describing a problem: why is the problem relevant.
%     the problem is not just relevant it is the final problem to solve
%     before solving the main problem of HWR.
%   * if describing a solution to a problem: what alternatives were
%     there to solve it, 
%     many different alternatives - see discussion of HWR, however,
%     the approach chosen here was the structural one/
%     why was this solution chosen? 
%     because of the possibility to interact with the recognition process
%     and reading partial results.
%     what made it the best choice? was it the optimal solution?
%     the other HWR approaches do not allow for the partial structural recognition
%     with linguistic components of characters.

% - How will this section be structured and organised?
%   The organisational structure of the section will contain
%   1. description of the process from  radical list to a character.
%   2. what if there are alternative radical lists?
%   3. what would've been an alternative solution?
%      directly going from exactly one radical list to exactly one chararcter.
%      s. 9/10 pixelwolke vs. reihenfolge

% - In what style will it be written?
%   The style of writing will be technical

% - Next action - what to write first?
%   The next part to write is to put the subparts into proper subsections.

% what's the similarity measure for
% characters?
% show requirements.
% s. 24 pseudocode

\section{Error Handling}
\label{sec:hwre:errorhandling}

% - Why this section? 
%   The purpose of this section is to demonstrate a crucial novelty of this 
%   HWR engline, the error handling module.
  
%   It would be off purpose, if it had to explain too much of the recognition 
%   process as such - that should've been done in other chapters.
  
% - What goes into this section?
%   The main content of this section is the 'way of an error'.
%   what happens if the character that is bound to be recognised just doesn't fit?
%   so there's an stroke that's not long enough and it's position is not
%   high enough within the character.

%   * if describing a problem: why is the problem relevant.
%     the problem is relevant for a learning application.
%     the purpose of the application is to teach the characters with an automated
%     recognition engine - one the central ''A.I.'' of this application
%     is the automated error recognition.

%   * if describing a solution to a problem: 
%     what alternatives were there to solve it, 
    
%     the alternative to the chosen process was a less flexible approach.
%     just measuring the absolute match - in size, shape pixel by pixel
%     (again pixelwolke) would've been of a lower quality.
%     compare skritter - it does not provide the high quality feedback.

%     why was this solution chosen? 
%     because the design of the application required high-quality feedback,
%     on a linguistic level.
    
%     what made it the best choice? 
%     because it was the only one that met the requirement of providing 
%     high-qualitiy feed-back.
    
%     was it the optimal solution?
%     who knows? - looks like it now, but evaluation will show.
%     depends on user experience. 

% - How will this section be structured and organised?
%   The organisational structure of the section 
%    1. error recognition
%    2. The Way of an error after recognition (error processing)
%    3. 
% - In what style will it be written?
%   The style of writing will be a technical description - probably no algorithms

% - Next action - what to write first?
%   The next part to write is to describe the error recognition.

\subsection{Error Recognition}
\label{sec:hwre:errorrecognition}

why this section? to demonstrate own achievements of error recognition.
the reader should know how it is done technically.

what goes into this section? the aspects of finding errors. finding errors
is not a straightforward trivial task - whenever something does not match
it is an error - doesn't work like that. instead, 
firstly, it needs to be made sure that it actually is an error.
meaning - not a recognition error, but a user error.
secondly, the type of error needs be identified.
see section \ref{sec:concept:sourcesoferror} (or handwritten page 58)
for sources of error.

how will this section be written?
technical - first describe how the error recognition integrates into the
recognition process, then how errors are identified.


\subsection{Error Processing}
\label{sec:hwre:errorprocessing}

%focus on technical aspects

why this section? 
actually the 'handling' or 'processing' aspect could be 
described in the recognition section \ref{sec:hwre:errorrecognition} as well.
so this section is only for a better overview, for document structure, 
thematically they are the same section. thus they are put together under
Error Handling \ref{sec:hwre:errorhandling}.

what goes into this section?
