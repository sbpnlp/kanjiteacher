\chapter{Handwriting Recognition Engine}
The sections of this chapter are more the result of a brainstorming 
than a  proper thought-through chapter design.
xxx: see santosh2009 for mathematical stuff: nice description of what I'm doing

\section{Capturing Data}
this should deal with how the data are captured during the process
mouse coordinates and stuff

\section{Data Format}
how is the data structured? radicals, strokes, characters, xml-format

\section{Database}
where did I get it from? how many chars are in there?
how are they accessible? what format?
