\chapter{Handwriting Recognition Engine}
\label{chap:handwritingrecognitionengine}

- Why this section? 
  The purpose of this section is to describe the software module of the 
  HWR engine.
  Any important of the software should be described. This is the core of the
  HWR part of the software and therefore needs description.
  It would be off purpose, if non-technical aspects of the HWR Engine would be 
  described.
- What goes into this section?
  The main content of this section is the complete functionality of the 
  HWR engine.
  It should become apparent how the HWR engine works.
  * if describing a problem: why is the problem relevant.
    The problem of HWR is relevant, because it is the crucial novelty of the
    application. The combination of a Kanji learning tool and a HWR is a new 
    thing. It enables user to practice writing Kanji. (maybe too high-level for
    this section, move to intro / motivation section).
  * if describing a solution to a problem: 
    what alternatives were there to solve it?    
    Instead of a HWR engine, the user could either not have a HWR engine and
    write on paper or not practice writing the kanji.
    why was this solution chosen? 
    because it creates an additional benefit, that was not available before.
    what made it the best choice? 
    the fact that it writing on paper is impractical and not practicing does
    not lead to the desired result.

    was it the optimal solution? given there is only not practicing and
    practicing on paper: yes.

- How will this section be structured and organised?
  The organisational structure of the section is already layed out in the
  sections and subsections.
- In what style will it be written?
  The style of writing will be technical. A technical description, using
  pseudocode.
- Next action - what to write first?
  The next part to write is the answers to the questions of all subsections.

%xxx always: what alternatives were there?

\section{Data Capturing}
\label{sec:hwre:datacapturing}
this should deal with how the data are captured during the process
mouse coordinates and stuff

- Why this section? 
  The purpose of this section is to describe the data capturing process.
  It would be off purpose, if it describes to much around - the devices, the
  transmission. This should focus on the capturing as such.
  It should not go into great deail.
  
- What goes into this section?
  The main content of this section is the technical data capturing.
  Programmatically generating a pen trajectory from reading mouse coordinates.
  
  
  * if describing a problem: why is the problem relevant.
    The relevance of the problem is evident: Without the user's writing,
    there would not be any handwriting recognition.

  * if describing a solution to a problem: what alternatives were
    there to solve it, why was this solution chosen? 
    The alternatives are not massively relevant here, since they come down
    to using different input devices, which is discussed elsewhere.

    what made it the best choice? 
    the fact that this is just how it is done.
    was it the optimal solution?
    yes.

- How will this section be structured and organised?
  The organisational structure of the section begins with describing the mobile 
  input GUI from a technical level.
  Then the class in the background that actually captures the mouse events.
  the capturing of the mouse events.
  the storing of the data points in lists.
 
- In what style will it be written?
  The style of writing will be technical. using pseudocode if required.
  however the algorithm is not relevant here.

- Next action - what to write first?
  The next part to write is the one about the GUI
  also the substructuring needs to be done as required.

this can be seen more generic as 'the lexicon', not necessarily
the linguistic information about the characters, but rather the whole
lexicon, including the point sequences.
where did I get it from? how many chars are in there?
how are they accessible? what format?

\ref{chap:conceptualdesignofkanjicoach} for possible sources of error

\subsection{Error Recognition}
\label{sec:hwre:errorrecognition}



why this section? to demonstrate own achievements of error recognition.
the reader should know how it is done technically.

what goes into this section? the aspects of finding errors. finding errors
is not a straightforward trivial task - whenever something does not match
it is an error - doesn't work like that. instead, 
firstly, it needs to be made sure that it actually is an error.
meaning - not a recognition error, but a user error.
secondly, the type of error needs be identified.
see section \ref{sec:concept:sourcesoferror} (or handwritten page 58)
for sources of error.

how will this section be written?
technical - first describe how the error recognition integrates into the
recognition process, then how errors are identified.


\subsection{Error Processing}
\label{sec:hwre:errorprocessing}

%focus on technical aspects



why this section? 
actually the 'handling' or 'processing' aspect could be 
described in the recognition section \ref{sec:hwre:errorrecognition} as well.
so this section is only for a better overview, for document structure, 
thematically they are the same section. thus they are put together under
Error Handling \ref{sec:hwre:errorhandling}.

what goes into this section?
