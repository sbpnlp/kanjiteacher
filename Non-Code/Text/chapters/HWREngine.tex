\chapter{Handwriting Recognition Engine}
\label{chap:handwritingrecognitionengine}
The sections of this chapter are more the result of a brainstorming 
than a  proper thought-through chapter design.
xxx: see santosh2009 for mathematical stuff: nice description of what I'm doing

why this section? 
what goes into this section?
  if describing a problem: why is the problem relevant.
  if describing a solution to a problem: what alternatives were
  there to solve it, why was this solution chosen? what made it the best
  choice? was it the optimal solution?
how will this section be structured and organised?
in what style will it be written?
next action - what to write first?


%xxx always: what alternatives were there?

\section{Database}
\label{sec:hwre:database}
this can be seen more generic as 'the lexicon', not necessarily
the linguistic information about the characters, but rather the whole
lexicon, including the point sequences.
where did I get it from? how many chars are in there?
how are they accessible? what format?

\subsection{Error Recognition}
\label{sec:hwre:errorrecognition}

why this section? 
what goes into this section?
  if describing a problem: why is the problem relevant.

  there to solve it, why was this solution chosen? what made it the best
  choice? was it the optimal solution?

in what style will it be written?
next action - what to write first?

why this section? to demonstrate own achievements of error recognition.
the reader should know how it is done technically.

what goes into this section? the aspects of finding errors. finding errors
is not a straightforward trivial task - whenever something does not match
it is an error - doesn't work like that. instead, 
firstly, it needs to be made sure that it actually is an error.
meaning - not a recognition error, but a user error.
secondly, the type of error needs be identified.
see section \ref{sec:concept:sourcesoferror} (or handwritten page 58)
for sources of error.

how will this section be written?
technical - first describe how the error recognition integrates into the
recognition process, then how errors are identified.


\subsection{Error Processing}
\label{sec:hwre:errorprocessing}

%focus on technical aspects

why this section? 
what goes into this section?
  if describing a problem: why is the problem relevant.
  if describing a solution to a problem: what alternatives were
  there to solve it, why was this solution chosen? what made it the best
  choice? was it the optimal solution?
how will this section be structured and organised?
in what style will it be written?
next action - what to write first?


why this section? 
actually the 'handling' or 'processing' aspect could be 
described in the recognition section \ref{sec:hwre:errorrecognition} as well.
so this section is only for a better overview, for document structure, 
thematically they are the same section. thus they are put together under
Error Handling \ref{sec:hwre:errorhandling}.

what goes into this section?
