i dont understand this crap


why this section? 
what goes into this section?
  if describing a problem: why is the problem relevant.
  if describing a solution to a problem: what alternatives were
  there to solve it, why was this solution chosen? what made it the best
  choice? was it the optimal solution?
how will this section be structured and organised?
in what style will it be written?
next action - what to write first?
