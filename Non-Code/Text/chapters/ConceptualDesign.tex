\section{Requirements of a Kanji Teaching E-Learning Application}
\label{sec:concept:requirements}

\subsection{General Considerations}
\label{sec:concept:generalconsiderations}

In order to create a concept for a Kanji teaching application,
a number of different aspects need to be taken into consideration.
These aspects emerge from the academic background concerning the Japanese script,
pedagocical and didactic knowledge about teaching languages and general
conceptions of e-learning applications.

Many efforts in designing e-learning applications are focused around the
teacher's view on learning. For designing an e-learning application that
is useful to students, the students view needs be taken into 
account~\shortcite{Alexander2007}. 
\shortciteANP{Ivashin2009}~\citeyear{Ivashin2009} critisises the technical 
dominance in e-learning and e-teaching processes, as the conceptual software
designs are not always supporting the didactic purpose of the software.
Therefore, the user view should be taken into account when conceptually designing
an e-learning application.
The requirement of a \emph{user-focused design} follows directly from this view.

For online e-learning, it is a known that readers only scan the textual 
information displayed. Therefore it is not useful to provide a user with 
large blocks of text, but rather with smaller chunks that encourage 
skimming over~\shortcite{Hamid2001}. It can be expected that the fact
that an e-learning process happens online does not greatly affect the user 
behaviour. Therefore, the observations made for online e-learning can
probably be applied to offline desktop application based e-learning.
The requirement of \emph{keeping textual information short and concise} derives
from the observation.

If e-learning is considered as a learning method in higher education, 
\emph{blended learning} seems to be the most suitable form of e-learning.
That means, combining classroom activities with e-learning 
methods~\shortcite{Hettinger2008,Kahiigi2008}. Language learning is not 
necessarily considered as higher education. In case of studying Japanese,
with its specific difficulties in language and the script, language learning
is taken to an intellectual level that is at least close to higher education.
Therefore, an e-learning application for any aspect of the Japanese language 
should not have the pretensions of posessing the capability 
to \emph{teach Japanese}. Japanese is a complex language with a complex script.
Therefore, e-learning applications should aim at supporting a learner's 
classroom efforts of studying the language. The requirement of 
\emph{focussing on a specific language aspect} can be drawn from this reasoning.
The prototype system designed in this work does not aim at being a complete
system, but rather offers individual learning components from which a user can 
choose what type of learning and which component best supports his study.

\subsection{Classification of a Kanji Teaching Application}
\label{sec:concept:classificationofakanjiteachingapplication}
%xxx What follows from E-Learning aspects of the whole thing?
%classification as an e-learning application.
%what type of application is it?
%which learning paradigm is followed?

In section~\ref{sec:elearn:classification} different types of e-learning systems
have been discussed. In the course of designing a prototype system, 
design choices need to be made.
The design choice for the prototype will be an offline e-learning system,
that runs on a desktop PC.
This design choice does not follow a conceptual requirement, in fact it ignores
\shortciteANP{Ivashin2009}'s~\citeyear{Ivashin2009} criticism of technical 
dominance in e-learning systems. The choice is a purely technical choice, 
yet, it is driven by a conceptual requirement.
The purpose of the e-learning environment is to test to what extend a handwriting
recognition engine can help studying the Kanji. In order to examine that 
research question, the handwriting recognition needs to be implemented and 
integrated with the e-learning system. 
Thus, the design choice for an offline system was inevitable in the sense that 
the technical limitations of on-line applications form an obstacle for pen 
input of characters and fast recognition procedures.

According to the definition given by~\shortcite{Richert2007} the Kanji teacher 
prototype is a \emph{computer based training} (CBT) system, as it does not use 
the Internet for communication or a webserver for storage. 
According to her research, another criterion for an identifying offline systems 
is that they are offered for distribution on CD-ROM or floppy disk.
That criterion can be regarded as obsolete, as it refers to specific storage 
media. Even if a higher level of abstraction is used to describe the
criterion, it is still obsolete, since \emph{a passive storage medium} is not 
necessary to describe what the criterion actually tries to define.
The criteria concerning communication and data storage are useful to confine
different types of e-learning applications.
Additionally, \emph{installability} can be used as a criterion for offline 
e-learning systems. \emph{Installability} here refers to 
\emph{the possibility to install a software on a computer system}, 
not the \emph{ease of installation}, 
which is defined in ISO9126 as \emph{installability} as 
well~\shortcite{Chua2004}. 
The ISO9126 type of installability will be taken into account during the software
evaluation, which is reported in chapter~\ref{chap:implementationevaluation}.

Concerning the level of interactivity described in 
section~\ref{sec:elearn:interactivity} the prototype designed in this work is 
aimed at a level higher than 
level~\emph{(\ref{elearn:class:changingcontent})~Changing the content of a 
component}. It is targeted between the 
levels~\emph{(\ref{elearn:class:generateobjects})~Generating objects or 
the content of a representation} 
and~\emph{(\ref{elearn:class:constructivemanipulative})~Constructive and 
manipulative actions through situation-dependent feedback}.
Concretely, a user can:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Change the ideal shape of a character by storing a new gold standard.
 \item Create new characters and their descriptions
 \item Receive situation-dependent feedback even on the newly created characters,
       due to the nature of the error recognition algorithm that evaluates
       mathematically the distance between a gold standard character and
       a an input.
       Additionally, characters are analysed structurally, therefore new 
       characters added by the user will automatically be classified and arranged
       among the other characters in the database of the system.
\end{itemize}
Thus, based on the levels of interactivity~\shortcite{Richert2007},
it can be concluded that the prototype provides a very high level of 
interaction. The levels serve as an evaluation measurement for the quality of 
e-learning applications.

\subsection{Conceptual Issues for E-Learning of Kanji}
\label{sec:elearn:conceptualissuesforelearningofkanji}

An e-learning application for Kanji should be an e-learning application for
vocabulary at the same time. It is conceptually not useful to split those two 
learning tasks~\shortcite{Stahlmann2004}.
Learning Kanji and Hànzì is a visual task. Learners need to focus on many little
details concerning a character. For example, the character~\cjk{曜} contains 18 
strokes that are difficult to distinguish from each other in a regular script 
size of 11pt. It is those details that make it difficult for a learner to 
remember a character. Thus, it is important to direct and guide the learner's 
perception of the characters towards a construct of Radicals, rather than a 
combination of a large number of strokes~\shortcite{Stahlmann2004}.
When attempting to split characters into conceptual sub units for the ease of
a learner, two different approaches lend themselves to this goal.

Firstly, splitting the characters into certain strokes. There are 26 original 
strokes in the writing system and each shape in all the characters can be drawn
with a combination of those strokes~\shortcite{Foljanty1984}.
This approach does not seem to ease the task of memorising the Kanji.
It may be fairly easy to memorise 26 strokes, but the fact that around 
2000 Kanji, necessary for reading Japanese, consist of these strokes does not
imply that memorising those becomes any less difficult.

Secondly, splitting the characters into graphemes. There are several shapes
in use in the Japanese and Chinese writing system. There are 79 graphemes in 
use~\shortcite{Hadamitzky1995}.
Using graphemes as a conceptual unit for a learner seems much more useful than
employing the strokes as a direct sub unit of the Kanji.
Memorising all the graphemes may help a learner to study the Kanji, because all 
sub shapes of the characters are known. However, graphemes do not necessarily 
bear a meaning. Therefore, seen from a perspective of perception and cognition, 
the coherence between the different parts of a Kanji would be purely visual.
That can help learners with an outstanding visual memory, but probably not
the majority with an average visual memory.

Thirdly, splitting the characters into Radicals. Radicals are the conceptual 
sub units of Kanji characters and they bear a meaning of their 
own. The number of Radicals is larger than the number of graphemes, but not all 
Radicals are in use and some graphemes are Radicals themselves at the same 
time~\shortcite{Hadamitzky1995}.
The Radicals do not only bear a meaning, but also have a function in character
formation (see section~\ref{sec:typologyofthekanji} for typology of the Kanji).
In order for a learner to memorise the Kanji, it seems useful to grasp the 
concept of Kanji typology and therefore character formation.
Equipped with the rules of character formation and a number of Radicals the
brain can link different parts of a Kanji character with other parts and 
other characters. For example when studiying phonograms, the majority of the
Kanji characters, knowledge about the pronunciation of the phonetic Radical
will help the learner.

Among those three possibilities it seems most suitable to use a combination of 
the second and the third. Conceptually, the characters will be split into 
Radicals, but the system must know about the concept of a grapheme, too.
Ideally, the system would have data that distinguishes both.

\section{Approaching the Specific Difficulties of the Japanese Script}
\label{sec:concept:tacklingdifficulties}

Section~\ref{sec:japanesedifficulties} deals with the typical problems that 
learners face when studying the Kanji. The Japanese script inevitably bears some 
difficulties when attempting to study it. The application should care for these 
problems by supporting these issues.


\subsection{Character Learning Aspects}
\label{sec:concept:charaterlearningaspects}

The specific problems mentioned in section~\ref{sec:learnersproblems} are:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Similar Kanji} \label{enum:charlearning:similarkanji}
  \item \textbf{Compounds} \label{enum:charlearning:compounds}
  \item \textbf{Unusual readings} \label{enum:charlearning:unusualreadings}
  \item \textbf{Alternative Kanji} \label{enum:charlearning:alternativekanji}
  \item \textbf{Homophones} \label{enum:charlearning:homophones}
  \item \textbf{Infrequent Jōyō Kanji} \label{enum:charlearning:infrequenjoyo}
  \item \textbf{Non-Jōyō Kanji} \label{enum:charlearning:nonjoyo}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Problems Out of Focus of the Prototype}
\label{sec:concept:problemsoutoffocus}

A Kanji teaching prototype cannot provide solutions for all of those problems,
but for some. It cannot provide a satisfying solution for 
problem~\ref{enum:charlearning:compounds} because the prototype deals with single
characters only. It is not useful to provide a solution for 
problem~\ref{enum:charlearning:unusualreadings} because studying the main
reading of a character is most important at the beginning. Especially, when
studying a new character, the learner should focus on the character shape and
the main reading, not on unsusual alternative readings. Kanji Coach aims
at teaching the Japanese script, not the full Japanese language.

Kanji Coach cannot provide a solution for 
problems~\ref{enum:charlearning:infrequenjoyo} 
and~\ref{enum:charlearning:nonjoyo}, memorising infrequent Jōyō 
Kanji and Non-Jōyō Kanji. These characters are difficult because they are 
infrequent. It seems more suitable for a learner to study the frequent characters
first in order to learn reading and writing. Thus, it is not plausible to pay 
special attention to this group of characters by presenting those moreoften to 
the learner.

Problem~\ref{enum:charlearning:alternativekanji} can be dealt with in an indirect
way. Following the concept that frequent characters and the main reading should 
be studied first, Kanji Coach does not provide any special form of presentation
for this group of characters. However, it has the ability to recognise 
alternative Kanji. In a scenario where a user is asked to input a certain 
character, an alternative character with the same meaning would be accepted. 
For instance, if a user is promped for the character for the number \emph{one}, 
which is usually written~'\cjk{一}', but enters the character~'\cjk{壱}' this 
input would be regarded as correct. However, the problem is not dealt with 
directly, with the same reason as for other problem types: The focus lies on 
studying the frequent characters.

\subsubsection{Problems In Focus of the Prototype}
\label{sec:concept:problemsinfocus}

Homophones are a general difficulty of the Japanese language. Many words are
ambiguous. Context can provide a better understanding, but even still,
often it is necessary to see the written Kanji character in order to know what is
meant with an expression~\shortcite{Foljanty1984}.
Therefore, it is essential to deal with 
problem~\ref{enum:charlearning:homophones}. 
Conceptually, this can be solved by providing special lessons that focus on
homonphones. Since the homophones are not homographs and therefore not homonyms
is is a natural process in studying characters to distinguish the characters
that are pronounced the same.



Kanji Coach can provide a solution for the main difficulty, 
problem~\ref{enum:charlearning:similarkanji}.





\subsubsection{Character Repetition}
\label{sec:concept:characterrepetition} %label in use already.

In section~\ref{sec:elearn:elearningoflanguages} the pure repetition of 
grammatical structures as a learning method has been critisised.
The system should account for that by not just forcing the user to
reproduce fixed structures. In fact, it should leave room for creativity.
%Zum Beispiel - radikale vorgeben und zeichen schreiben lassen.
%und ganz generell: toleranzgrenzen erlauben kreativitaet allein schon deswegen,
%weil selbst der zeichenstift benutzt wird.
