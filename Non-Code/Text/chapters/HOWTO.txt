before you change anything, right click the folder
    'steven's thesis'
and say
    "SVN Update"
==> all my changes will come to your hard disc,  so you're looking at the newest version.

if you change any files, don't just correct bits of text, because that'd be illegal,
I have to swear that I did the work myself, therefore just put in comments for my
consideration...

in order for me to recognise the comments, mark them somehow,
at best, always the same way, so I can find them, if I search for a certain character string
maybe something like:

    jacky comments:
    this sentence above is total crap, it's to long and I don't know what you mean by it.
    it would be better to put it like this:
    This is the short version of the sentence.


after you finish your changes, right click the folder
    'steven's thesis'
and say
    "SVN Commit"

that way you should hardly ever get any conflicts.
