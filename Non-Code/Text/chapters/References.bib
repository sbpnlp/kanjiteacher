  abstract =     {In this paper, we give a comprehensive description
                  of our writer-independent online handwriting
                  recognition system frog on hand. The focus of this
                  work concerns the presentation of the
                  classification/training approach, which we call
                  cluster generative statistical dynamic time warping
                  (CSDTW). CSDTW is a general, scalable, HMM-based
                  method for variable-sized, sequential data that
                  holistically combines cluster analysis and
                  statistical sequence modeling. It can handle general
                  classification problems that rely on this sequential
                  type of data, e.g., speech recognition, genome
                  processing, robotics, etc. Contrary to previous
                  attempts, clustering and statistical sequence
                  modeling are embedded in a single feature space and
                  use a closely related distance measure. We show
                  character recognition experiments of frog on hand
                  using CSDTW on the UNIPEN online handwriting
                  database. The recognition accuracy is significantly
                  higher than reported results of other handwriting
                  recognition systems. Finally, we describe the
                  real-time implementation of frog on hand on a Linux
                  Compaq iPAQ embedded device.},
