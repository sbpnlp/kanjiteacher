In this work I present and application that uses state of the art 
Chinese/Japanese handwriting recognition methods in order to provide 
an Kanji teaching application with an error correction.

Conceptually, the application is an e-learning environment for Japanese 
characters, intended for the foreign learner of the Japanese language. 
In order to provide more than a  multiple choice method, like most other 
systems, the application contains a handwriting recognition engine that can
be used preferably with a hand-held device like a PDA, but generally any 
stylus input device.
