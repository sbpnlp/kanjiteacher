\section{Abstract}

why this section? 
what goes into this section?
  if describing a problem: why is the problem relevant.
  if describing a solution to a problem: what alternatives were
  there to solve it, why was this solution chosen? what made it the best
  choice? was it the optimal solution?
how will this section be structured and organised?
in what style will it be written?
next action - what to write first?


In this work I present and application that uses state of the art 
Chinese/Japanese handwriting recognition methods in order to provide 
an Kanji teaching application with an error correction.

Conceptually, the application is an e-learning environment for Japanese 
characters, intended for the foreign learner of the Japanese language. 
In order to provide more than a  multiple choice method, like most other 
systems, the application contains a handwriting recognition engine that can
be used preferably with a hand-held device like a PDA, but generally any 
stylus input device.
