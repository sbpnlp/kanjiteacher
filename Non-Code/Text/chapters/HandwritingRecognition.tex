\subsection{The Art of Handwriting}
\label{sec:theartofhandwriting}

Handwriting is a very personal skill to individuals. It consists of graphical
marks on a surface, it can be used to identify a person, it has the main
purpose of communication. This is achivied by drawing letters or other 
\emph{graphemes}, which in turn represent parts of a language.
The characters have a certain basic shape, which must be recognisable
for a human in order for the communication process to function.
There are rules for the combination of letters, which have the ability - if
known to the reader - to help recognise a character or word.

Handwriting was developed as a means of communication and to expand one's own
memory. With the advent of each new technologies the question arose, 
if handwriting was going to survive. However, the opposite seems to be the 
truth: For example, the printing press increased the number of documents
available and therefore increased the number of people who learned to read
and write. Through the increased rate of alphabetisation, naturally there was
an increased use of handwriting as a means of communication.

In various situations handwriting seems much more practical than typing on a
keyboard. For instance children at school are using notepads and pencils or
ink pens, which are regarded as a better tool to teach writing by German 
teachers. Therefore it can be concluded that there is little danger of
the extinction of handwriting as a communication tool. In fact, as 
the length of handwritten messages decreases, the number of people using 
handwriting increases \shortcite{Plamondon2000}.

\subsection{Automated Recognition of Handwriting}
\label{sec:autorecoofhandwriting}

\subsubsection{Short History of Handwriting recognition}
\label{sec:shorthistoryofhwr}

\emph{Handwriting recognition} (HWR) as a technological discipline performed 
by machines has been around for many years. The quality of the systems 
recognising handwriting has improved over the decades. It is the key 
technology to pen-based computer systems. The first research papers 
concerned with \emph{pattern recognition} on computers were published 
in the late 1950ies, \emph{Handwriting recognition} as an individual subject in 
the early 1960ies. \shortcite{Goldberg1915} describes in a US Patent
a machine that can recognise alphanumeric characters as early as 1915. 
However, despite the surprise how early such a device was invented,
it should be taken into consideration that that was before the times 
of modern computers, therefore the methods he employs are quite different 
from the algorithms used after the advent of computers, more concretely, 
computers with screens. 

\shortcite{Tappert1990} describe in their review the development of 
handwriting recognition, which was a popular research topic in the early 
1970ies and then again in the 1980ies, due to the increased availability 
of pen-input devices.  Generally speaking, handwriting recognition (HWR) 
involves automatic conversion of handwritten text into a machine readable 
character encoding like ASCII or UTF-8. Typical HWR-environments include 
a pen or stylus that is used for the handwriting, a touch-sensitive surface, 
which the user writes on and a an application that interprets the strokes 
of the stylus on the surface and converts them into digital text. 
Usually, the writing surface captures the x-y coordinates of the stylus 
movement.

\subsubsection{Recognition vs Identification}
\label{sec:recognitionvsidentification}

Handwriting recognition is the task of transforming a spatial language 
representation into a symbolic representation. In the English language
(and many others) the symbolic representation is typically 8-bit ASCII.
However, with \emph{Unicode} being around for more than a decade now,
storage space on harddisks not being as much of an issue any more and
\emph{RAM} being readily available to the Gigabytes, it has become more 
common to use a \emph{UTF-8}  encoding, which is a variable-length character 
encoding for Unicode \shortcite{Unicode2000}.
Akin disciplines to handwriting recognition are 
\emph{handwriting identification}, which is the task of identifying the author
of a handwritten text sample from a set of writers, assuming that each
handwriting style can be seen as individual to the person who wrote it.
The task of \emph{signature verification} is to determine if a given signature
stems from the person who's name is given in the signature.
Thus, handwriting identification and verification can be used for 
analysis in the field of jurisdiction. They determine the individual features
of a handwritten sample of a specific writer and compare those
to samples given by a different or the same writer. By analysing those 
features one can find out the authenticity of a piece of handwritten text.

\subsubsection{Interpretation of Handwriting}
\label{sec:interpretationofhandwriting}

Handwriting recognition and interpretation are trying to filter out the 
writer-specific variations and extract the text message only. This conversion
process can be a hard task, even for a human. Humans use context knowledge
in order to determine the likeliness of a certain message in a certain context.
For instance, a handwritten message on a shopping list that could be read
as \emph{bread} or \emph{broad} due to the similarities of the characters 
for 'e' and 'o' in some cursive handwriting styles, will be interpreted 
as \emph{bread}, since it is a much more likely interpretation in the 
shopping list domain. However, if the next word on the shopping list 
is \emph{beans}, the likelyhood for the interpretation of the first word
as \emph{broad} rises, because the collocation \emph{broad beans} is a
sequence that is likely on a shopping list, at least more likely than
having the interpretation \emph{bread} and then \emph{beans} without a
clear separation between the two. 
Even with non-handwritten, but printed characters, the human mind can be 
tricked because of the brain's ability to perform these interpretations 
within miliseconds without conscious thinking.
An example of that are modern T-Shirt inscriptions, that state things like
\emph{Pozilei} in a white font on a green ground (the German police colours 
in most federal states are green and white), 
which German native speakers usually read as \emph{Polizei} (police).

\section{Hardware requirements}
\label{sec:hardwarerequirements}
xxx: see santosh2009 basic tools / techniques / digitizer technology, 

Several different hardware commercial products are available in order to
capture the x-y coordinates of a stylus or pen. Graphics tablet like the
products of the Wacom Co., Ltd.\footnote{www.wacom.com} are popular input
devices for hand motions and hand gestures. The use of pen-like input devices 
has also been recommended, since 42\% of mouse users report feelings of 
weakness, stiffness and general discomfort in the wrist and hand when 
using the mouse for long periods \shortcite{Woods2002}. Moreover there are
PDAs and Tablet PCs, where the writing suface serves as an output device,
i.e. an display at the same time. New generation mobile phones also contain
touch-displays, but for those it is more common to be operated without a 
stylus. Those devices interpret user gestures, however the input is given 
directly with the users fingers. Another rather new development are real-ink 
digital pens. With those, a user can write on paper with real ink, and the pen
stores the movements of the pen-tip on the paper. The movements are transferred 
to a computer later. It can be expected that with technologies like Bluetooth
it may be possible to transfer those data in real-time, not delayed.

\section{On-Line vs. Off-Line recogniton}
\label{sec:onlinevsoffline}

xxx: see plamondon2000 1.5. blend systems!
xxx: see santosh2009: off-line / on-line chapter

\emph{On-line} HWR means that the input is converted in \emph{real-time}, 
\emph{dynamically}, while the user is writing. This recognition can lag behind
the user's writing speed. \shortcite{Tappert1990} report average writing rates 
of 1.5-2.5 characters/s for English alphanumerics or 0.2-2.5 characters/s for 
Chinese characters. In online systems, the data usually comes in as a sequence 
of coordinate points.

\emph{Off-line} HWR is the application of a HWR algorithm after the writing.
It can be performed at any time after the writing has been completed. That 
includes recognition of data transferred from the real-ink pens 
(see \ref{sec:hardwarerequirements}) to a computing device after the writing
has been completed. The stadard case of off-line HWR, however, is a subset of
optical character recognition (OCR). An scanner tranfers the physical image 
on paper into a bitmap, the character recognition is performed on the bitmap.
An OCR system can recognise several hundred characters per second.

On-line devices have the dynamic information of the writing, since each point 
coordinate is captured at a specific point of time. Also, the system know the
input stroke sequence, their direction and speed of writing. All these 
information can be an advantage for an on-line system, however, off-line systems
have used algorithms of line-thinning, such that the data consits of point
coordinates, similar to the input of online systems \shortcite{Tappert1990}.

\section{Typical On-Line HWR application}
\label{sec:typicalonlinehwrapplication}

A typical HWR application has several parts that follow up on each other in a
procedural fashion. 
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Data capturing}: The data is captured through an input device 
  like a writing surface and a stylus.
\item \textbf{Preprocessing}: The data is segmented, noise reduction like smoothing and filtering are applied.
\item \textbf{Character Recognition}: Feature analysis, stroke matching, time, 
direction and curve matching.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The current State-of-the-Art in Japanese and Chinese Character Recognition}
From the 1990s onwards, On-Line Japanese and Chinese Character Recognition 
(OJCCR) systems have been aiming at loosening the restrictions imposed on 
the writer when using an OJCCR system. Their focus shifted from recognition 
of block style script ('regular' script) to fluent style script, 
which is also called 'cursive' style. Accuracies of up to about 95\% are
achieved in the different systems.

xxx: \cite{Nakagawa2008} und \cite{Nakai2003} 
xxx: zu guter letzt: \cite{Santosh2009}

\subsection{Overview of a typical OJCCR system}

xxx:  \cite{LiuJaegerNakagawa2004} have said: 

xxx:  graphic:
handwritten -> character segmentation -> ... -> character codes
see fig. 3 of liujaegernakagawa2004

Broadly speaking, from an abstract viewpoint, typical handwriting recognition 
systems for Chinese and Japanese characters have the same structure like the
systems for latin-based alphbets. The process begins with \emph{Character 
segmentation}, goes on with \emph{Preprocessing}, \emph{Pattern descrpition}, 
\emph{Pattern recognition} and ends with \emph{Contextual processing}, 
if applicable. However, there are differences to the standard process, due to 
the nature of the Chinese characters (see \ref{sec:methodsofhwrsystems}).
Especially the pattern representation is divers in the different OJCCR systems,
whereas it is naturally more alike in the systems focussing on latin characters.
This is due to the fact that the latin alphabet is rather small, but has more
variation concerning writing style, whereas the Chinese alphabet has a larger 
inventory of characters, but less variation in how to write a character - at
least - it is widely agreed upon a 'proper' stroke sequence for a character,
even across country borders.
