What can we do for other languages, using similar character sets?
This HWR as a service for other applications?

What can be done with future devices?
With a multi-touch device?
With a pressure-sensitive device?

See source of section~\ref{sec:datacapturing} for this paragraph here:
xxx: 
The reason for not using pressure intensity as a recognition feature might be 
that it is plausible to assume that pressure intensity is even more individual 
to the writer than the shape of the drawn characters. 
Therefore, featuring pressure intensity in a HWR application could add more 
noise to the data. However, the differences in pressure intensity 
between different characters drawn by the same writer should be analysed.
[xxx put the speculation about pressure intensity into outlook chapter? 
something along the lines of progress in device technology, 
subsection pressure intensity of tablets? Or maybe refer from here to
outlook chapter?]
