This project uses state of the art Chinese/Japanese handwriting recognition methods in order to provide an Kanji teaching application with an error correction.

Conceptually, the application is an e-learning environment for Japanese characters, intended for the foreign learner of the Japanese language. In order to provide more than a  multiple choice method, like most other systems, the application contains a handwriting recognition engine that can be used preferably with a handheld device like a PDA, but generally any stylus input device.

The handwriting recognition method used is similar to the one proposed by Chen, J.-W. and S.-Y. Lee (1996) in their article "A Hierarchical Representation for the Reference Database of On-Line Chinese Character Recognition" in "Advances in Structural and Syntactical Pattern Recognition", Volume
1121 of "Lecture Notes in Computer Science", pp. 351--360. Berlin/Heidelberg, Germany: Springer.

Nakagawa, M., J. Tokuno, B. et al. (2008) report their "Recent Results of Online Japanese Handwriting Recognition
and Its Applications" in D. Doermann and S. Jaeger (Eds.) "Arabic and Chinese Handwriting Recognition", Volume 4768 of "Lecture Notes in Computer Science", pp. 170--195. Berlin/Heidelberg, Germany: Springer.
The latter article gives important insights into character modeling, which are employed in this application.
